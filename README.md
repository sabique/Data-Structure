# Stack

*A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.*

A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top. 

A helpful analogy is to think of a stack of books; you can remove only the top book, also you can add a new book on the top.
